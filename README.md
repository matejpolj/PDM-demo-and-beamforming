# PDM-demo-and-beamforming
## Repository for master's thesis implementation of PDM demodulation matrix with beamforming stage.

This repository contains VHDL code used in master's thesis.  

PDM demodulation folder contains demodulation example, implemented on MiniZed board.  
Complete system folder contains demodulation and beamforming implementacion on ZedBoard with 4 MEMS microphone matrix.  


All code is provided without projects. Block design in Vivado is provided for both examples.
